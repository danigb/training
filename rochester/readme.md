# the format

We will have short lectures throughout the day on
various topics.

Between the presentations, you the participant should
experiment with the topics and tools covered in the
lectures and should think up a new or existing project
to hack on and get help with throughout the day.

I'm here to introduce new ideas and to help you get
unstuck!
