# modules

This document covers userland packages you can use to manipulate and consume
streams.

The core stream APIs are very tricky to implement correctly, so generally
speaking it's much easier and faster to use these libraries.

# through2

create transform streams

``` js
var through = require('through2')
```

You don't necessarily need to use the transform side of things.

# split2

# concat-stream

# collect-stream

# from2
